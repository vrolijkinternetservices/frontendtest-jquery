    Front-end developer test, v1.0a.
        Covers: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery 
        Note:   CSS3 is allowed, using the internet is allowed.
        Files:  index.html, script.js, style.css, data.json
    
        
1.  Use the "index.html" file in this folder to create a form using HTML and CSS. 
    Refer to "example.gif" in this folder as example. 
    Note: The red fields are fields where an error can occur in a later stage. Treat these fields
    as the other two and do not include the red backgrounds for now.
    
2.  Create a nice submit button at the bottom of this form and use only HTML and CSS. Be a little
    creative with the look & feel, but do not spend too much time on it and do not use sprites/images.
    
3.  There's a form field called housenumber. Make sure only numbers are allowed in this field, so
    users can not type '12A' in this field, but only '12' for example. This should also be the case
    after a user copies '12A' into this field. Bind a function to this field using javascript/jQuery,
    but do not assign the trigger function to your HTML. (Do not use '<input onblur="" onfocus="" />').
    Note: There are more ways to do this. What's important is that a user is able to see why his information
    is being corrected, and that he can not post his form with the incorrect information.
 
4.  Although we work in 'Breukelen', we only like the city Amsterdam. That's why you should make sure that when
    a user specifies an other city than Amsterdam in the city field, this field (or space around this field) should
    color red. Or something like that... Make it clear for a user that he's made a mistake.
    Remove the errors again when the user has specified Amsterdam as city.
    Note: Amsterdam should be treated case-insensitive.
   
5.  There a JSON file in this folder. Let's say that we already know a few things about the user. Make sure the
    form fields are pre-filled with the JSON data.
